# Pclub_GameofBlocks_project
So its just simple game of snake and ladders i hadn't applied any graphics and even nothing to print just player's postion and winner.
It could have more elements but as only core logics were required so i did that only .
you can run in this in terminal or vs code nothing special its just a cpp file .

#for assgn1_gob
its just a simple python file you just have to give an input that could be anything and as an output you would get the required value of nonce and time taken to find that
