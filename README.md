# Pclub_GameofBlocks_project
So its just simple game of snake and ladders i hadn't applied any graphics and even nothing to print just player's postion and winner.
It could have more elements but as only core logics were required so i did that only .
you can run in this in terminal or vs code nothing special its just a cpp file .
